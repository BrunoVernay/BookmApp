Chrome App with Polymer v1

To manage Bookmarks

Here I used the Starter Kit https://developers.google.com/web/tools/polymer-starter-kit/
This structure made with `yo polymer`
See https://github.com/yeoman/generator-polymer

Yeoman install: 
`sudo npm install -g yo
sudo npm install -g generator-polymer
`

BUT, this generator is for "general" web apps. There is a https://github.com/yeoman/generator-chromeapp that will leverage Polymer, but not ready yet!
This branch is on-hold until this generator is available.
